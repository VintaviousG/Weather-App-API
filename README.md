# Weather App
### What is the project about:
This is a simple weather app, that allows users to freely get local weather information.


### How The Project Works:
When the user visits the website, the user is asked to allow access to a user's geographical position. For the weather information, I used the WeatherBit.io API,provided by RapidAPI. RapidAPI. Simply for the API to work, latitude and longitude are needed from the user. I use The HTML Geolocation API to get a user's geographical position. When the user allows for geolocation, the user's temperature, city, country, state, and weather description information are shown. 
### Languages Used
I used HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript for the project.
